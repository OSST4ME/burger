Eat-Da-Burger
This app uses Handlebars, MySQL, Node, Express, and a homemade ORM to create a burger logger. I followed the MVC design pattern and Node to Query the route data for the app. Handlebars was used to generate all of my HTML.

Instructions
Type a burger name into the app and add it.
Burger will be added to the "Burgers Available to Eat" section of the page.
Select a burger you would like to Devour from the "Burgers Available to Eat List".
Burger will be moved to the "Burgers That Have Been Devoured" section of the page.
